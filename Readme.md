# React Fundamentals
Well this one was a fun one. It's partially incomplete. Saying this up front. I spent the majority of my lunch break working through this one and where I could during questions.

On Friday, my computer suffered an OS failure. While I was able to backup my projects I've been working on, it was on a different OS than I'm using now. (I moved from Arch to Ubuntu).

This created some dependency hell for me. Unfortunately, after working through probably a little less than half of the modules, I had to remove everything and start over. Had I been smart, I would have copied would I could have copied (long urls lol)

Anyway, that's my story.
