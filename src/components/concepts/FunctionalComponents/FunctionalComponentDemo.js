        <h1>Functional Components</h1>
        <p>
          Functional Components are the primary tool used in React to build a
          small, modular piece of your application.

        <dl>
          <dt>Can access state</dt>
          <dd>
            By passing props, Functional Components are capable of both
            rendering state variables for display, as well as updating the value
            of state variables. We'll take a deeper dive into state and props
            later on - so don't fret if that doesn't make sense right now.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            No <i>this</i> keyword
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Class components or stateful components in React will always require
            the use of the <i>this</i> keyword when initializing an object using
            the constructor method. Functional Components (or display
            components), however, are instanceless - meaning they have no access
            to the <i>this</i> keyword.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <i>return()</i>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Functional components as well as class components must return a
            single element - but the single element returned from the function
            may have children elements nexted inside of it.
